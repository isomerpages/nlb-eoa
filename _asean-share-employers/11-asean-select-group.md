*Buoyed by these successes, the company says it has big plans for the future. It opened a central kitchen in KL, which has enabled the company to significantly expand its business capabilities and raise productivity. This has allowed Select to scale-up at a quicker pace. It hopes to open several more outlets in KL across several brands in the coming years. It is now also working with IE to launch a food court, which will house several Select brands and other Singapore tenants too, in the integrated lifestyle development Empire City @ Damansara KL.*

*“I think in the near future, we might franchise to Penang, Ipoh and East Malaysia as well,” said Mr Tan [managing director of Select Group].*

*Select is now also setting its sights beyond Malaysia. IE is supporting the firm as it plans to make strides into other promising markets in the region.*

*“We are now exploring Indonesia and Myanmar, and are likely to adopt the same way of entering the market, but are identifying the characteristics of that local market first,” said Mr Tan.*
