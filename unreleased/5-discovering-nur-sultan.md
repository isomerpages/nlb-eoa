[**Nazarbayev and the making of Kazakhstan**](http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=13201136){:target="_blank"}

For centuries, the tribes of Kazakhstan had been plundered and conquered by foreign invaders. The most ruthless of these were the 20th century leaders of the Soviet Union; however, after its collapse, it was Nursultan Nazarbayev (after whom the city of Nur-Sultan is named), who emerged as the new President of the nation state. This book tells a riveting story of how Kazakhstan has capitalised on its natural resources (including oil) to become one of the great economic success stories of the modern era.

This book seeks to understand the national identity of Kazakhstan, the “newest powerhouse of Asia” and an increasingly successful player on the world stage. “From its President to its painters, poets, economists and entrepreneurs, this is a nation confidently on the move.”

[**Kazakhstan's new era**](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/Main/Browse?startsWith=P){:target="_blank"}

Since 1998, a wave of new, sometimes futuristic, construction has transformed Astana (now known as Nur-Sultan), the once-sleepy left bank of the Ishim river that criss-crosses the area. The pace of change has been a testament to the country's tremendous resources-powered economic growth as glittering buildings designed by the likes of renowned British architect Norman Foster sprang up in just a few years.

[**Kazakhstan Tourism Report - Q3 2019**](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/Main/Browse?startsWith=P){:target="_blank"}

Kazakhstan is targeting tourism as a key growth area, as the country looks to diversify its sources of income and reduce its reliance on commodities. Under the original 2020 Tourism Development Strategy, the target for inbound travel was set at eight million visitors by 2020 (a target that was achieved in 2018) alongside 270,000 tourism-related jobs. Development of tourism has been divided into several sectors including Nur-Sultan, Heart of Eurasia; Almaty, Free Cultural Zone of Kazakhstan; Revival of the Great Silk Road; Caspian Gates (beach tourism and cultural tourism); and Pearl of Altai (the World of Natural Wonders and ecological tourism).

This article reports that traditional diesel buses in Kazakhstan’s city streets could gradually become a thing of the past as officials in Nur-Sultan plan to launch fleets of electric buses to curb air pollution and carbon emissions. Kazakhstan’s second-largest city of one million people may introduce its first fleet of 100 electric buses by the end of this year, according to Altai Kulginov, Nur-Sultan’s mayor.

The city of Nur-Sultan is joining a long list of global financial centres. Although it has much to do to catch up with the likes of London and Frankfurt, it is already making impressive progress. Kazakhstan may not be that well known, as a financial centre or otherwise, but this looks set to change thanks to its central location near Asia, Russia and Europe.

[**Nur-Sultan: "Smart City" pioneer**](https://www.euronews.com/2019/10/17/nur-sultan-smart-city-pioneer){:target="_blank"}

The World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) held its annual global conference in Nur-Sultan, the capital of Kazakhstan in 2019, thanks to the city’s attempts to use technology to improve resident’s lives. Nur-Sultan’s population has tripled since the nineties and the Kazakh capital is relatively young which makes it a lot easier to begin implementing new approaches to develop the urban environment. One example is the city’s mobile application, that in several clicks, gives residents access to more than 75 services in the city - public transport, education, taxes and medical services.
