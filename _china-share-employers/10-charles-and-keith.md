*The success of shoe label and fashion retailer Charles & Keith International on the global front can be attributed to its ability to have a firm grip of its operations across its vast network of stores and factories.*

*To ensure that the burgeoning business is run smoothly, Charles & Keith made sure that it had control over the entire chain of operations.*

*In the area of manufacturing, more than 30 factories in Malaysia and China make shoes exclusively for the company.*

*“We didn’t want the factories to produce for other people, so we needed to ‘take over’ and give them orders,” explained Mr Fong [executive director of Charles & Keith International], who joined the company in 2000.*

*Similarly, Charles & Keith ran a tight ship in areas ranging from branding, retail and supply chain to design.*

*Mr Fong stressed: “In internationalisation, if you don’t have control, things will go haywire.*

*“If you want to franchise but can’t control your partner, what’s going to happen? Branding has to be consistent and if you want to be consistent, you need to be in control.”*
