*CapitaLand began in 2000 through the merger of Pidemco and DBS Land.*

*“At that time, we had to decide the new direction for CapitaLand. And after the merger, we realised that the company is of a significant size, and it was important that we do not just develop in the Singapore market because the Singapore market is essentially quite small relative to the world economy. So, we decided we had to go overseas.”*

*As part of CapitaLand’s international push, Mr Lim went to China in 2000 to manage and develop its business there.*

*As the chief executive of CapitaLand China Holdings at that time – a role he held from November 2000 to June 2009 – Mr Lim built a team and the company’s presence in China.*

*“When I was there… I listened to the radio, watched the TV there, read the local paper, got a good sense of what the people are concerned about. You have to empathise with the people there and over time, they will accept you as one of them.”*

*“Many of the people that we send from Singapore to be posted overseas must have that mindset, they have to be open-minded. They have to integrate, put together things from two different environments and come up with something that is better.”*
