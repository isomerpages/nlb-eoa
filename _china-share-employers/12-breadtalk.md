*If you want something done, you have to do it yourself, even if that means stepping back, leaving your thriving business here and venturing into foreign fields.*

*That was the strategy adopted by BreadTalk Group chairman George Quek when he took the gamble of setting up shop in China in 2003.*

*Mr Quek, 57, spent most of his time in the country to personally oversee the franchise outlets, a decision he acknowledges was not easy.*

*Letting a Singaporean manager work alone in China while you manage him from Singapore is difficult, he added. Mr Quek tells The Straits Times in Mandarin: “Everyone has made the same mistake, including me. As Singaporeans, we think Singaporeans are good, so we send them to China. But a manager manages fewer people here than in China.”*

*“And for someone without experience, who is sometimes unable to make a decision on the spot, it can’t work unless you go there to take charge.”*
