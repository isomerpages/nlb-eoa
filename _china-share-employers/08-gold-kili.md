*Mr Ng [founder of Gold Kili] says the company’s vast international experience has enabled it to gain deeper insights into various cultures, business approaches and taste preferences in various markets.*

*From their experiences overseas, the company has also been inspired to experiment with new and interesting concoctions. Their new Matcha Ginger Latte is a blend of traditional drinks from different countries – ginger being a staple ingredient in Chinese and Indian drinks, and matcha green tea from Japan.*

*“SMEs tend to focus too much on day to day operations – we don’t really think about the kinds of support or grants we can get from the government to help fuel our growth.”*

*“Economic agencies such as IE Singapore has been in overseas markets for many years and have many connections we can tap on,“ Mr Ng says…*

*Ultimately, Mr Ng believes that building trust with his customers is paramount in the food business, especially when other brands like China, Hong Kong and even Taiwan have been rocked by food scandals.*

*“We invest significantly in research and development to maintain the high quality of our Singapore-made products.*

*It gives us immense satisfaction that consumers from markets around the world love our drinks and say they can’t get a similar taste anywhere else, even from the bigger brands,” he says.*
