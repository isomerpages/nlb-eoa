### **About the Speakers**

**China**<br>
**Aik-Ping Ng**<br>
**Engineer turned finance professional based in Greater China**

Aik-Ping Ng is a seasoned finance and investment professional with close to 20 years of international and China-based experience spanning private equity, strategic M&A and private wealth management. He currently works at a large financial institution and is a part-time author, mentor and Enneagram coach. A Terman scholar at Stanford University in the United States, Aik-Ping also teaches finance at Renmin University in Beijing, China. He is also an avid golfer, claims to dance salsa, and struggles at the piano.

How should young Singaporeans gear up to embrace the opportunities presented by China and the rest of Asia? What are the emerging trends and opportunities in a post-pandemic China? Come draw inspiration from Aik-Ping as he shares his personal story and provides an insider's view into China's transformation through the lens of an overseas Singaporean.

**India**<br>
**Shobha Tsering Bhalla**<br>
**Managing Director, India Se Media and Director, Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce & Industry Board**

Shobha Tsering Bhalla is a veteran journalist and media entrepreneur with extensive experience as a senior print and online journalist. In 1989, she joined The Straits Times as a business correspondent and was the first non-resident Indian journalist to have an opinion column in The Sunday Times. In 2007, she founded India Se Media, the first magazine/media company catering to the India diaspora in Singapore and Southeast Asia. Shobha is also on the board of the Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce & Industry (SICCI) and is the Chairman of SHE@SICCI, which helps socially and economically vulnerable Singapore Indian women entrepreneurs grow their businesses in the post-COVID era.

Although India is not a signatory to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), its “Act East” policy forms an important part of its Indo-Pacific vision, which places ASEAN its core. With India’s strategic northeast set to play a big role in connecting the subcontinent with Southeast Asia, enhanced by India’s liberalised labour market, how can Singaporeans gain a first-mover advantage in Northeast India? What are the possibilities of tie-ups and cooperation between Singapore and Northeast India? Join Shobha as she shares the cultural similarities between Singapore and Northeast India, as well as how Singapore SMEs with interests in labour-intensive sectors could explore opportunities in India.
