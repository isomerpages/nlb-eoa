*From his experience in breaking into an overseas market, Mr Ho [chief executive officer and founder of Trentios] emphasised the importance for SMEs to identify each country/city’s consumer challenges. He cited an example where his team had to produce an energy efficient air-con that works for customers in Indonesia. Village households typically have an electricity limit of 1000 watt, but a typical portable air-con unit requires at least 762 watts of energy. This caused even the best available portable air-con in the market, to trip [the electricity circuits of] the village households, when used with other appliances.*

*Taking the deep consumer need head on, the dedicated R&D team at Trentios managed to make an energy efficient portable air-con that ran on only 162 watts. Mr Ho explained, “If it’s not the right product and you go into the market, it (wouldn’t) benefit the consumer. You’ll spoil the brand and everyone will talk about it … then you’ll have a problem.”*

*Mr Ho also insisted that Trentios’ products must be able to elevate the ‘Singapore brand’.*

*‘I make sure my products really benefit the consumers. If not, there is no point. Singapore is so small… trust towards us is very important,’ said Mr Ho.*
