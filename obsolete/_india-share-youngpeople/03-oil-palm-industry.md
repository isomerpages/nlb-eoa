*Ruchi Soya is the leader in India’s vegetable oil sector, accounting for about 14% of downstream market share and half of the domestic trade in palm oil.*

*Ruchi has several refineries across India – in Patalganga, Mangalore, Chennai, Haldia, Kakinada and Kandla. The refineries are strategically located near ports for logistical efficiency. We were invited to tour Ruchi’s Kakinada refinery, and were greeted with a neat production line which included both mechanical and manual processes. Every detail in the production line is closely controlled and monitored.*
