*Even though there was often a language barrier as the locals did not speak much English, they were able to communicate through body language and gestures. The students did pick up a bit of Thai in order to communicate more effectively but took some time to get used to the accent. However, they realized that through careful listening and patience, they were able to pick up the language.*

 *Through this internship, the students learnt more about work, life and friendships. They also challenged themselves to live life a little more simply, and adapted surprisingly well to it. The most important lesson was probably realising that not all lessons can be found in books but instead through experiencing, observing and interacting with the people they meet.*
