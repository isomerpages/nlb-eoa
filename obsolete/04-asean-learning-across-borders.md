*Students from the School of Informatics & IT (IIT) participated in the third run of the Temasek Foundation International Specialist in Community Action and Leadership Exchange Programme (TFI SCALE).*

*From 18 Mar to 31 Mar 2018, IIT students went on the Vietnam leg of the programme and were hosted by their HUST participants in return. To learn more about the Vietnamese culture, the IIT students had basic lessons in the Vietnamese language, and had a lecture on ‘Overview of Governance, Culture, Economics and Sustainable Development of Vietnam.’ To help IIT students appreciate the culture of Vietnam, the IIT students visited places like the Ngoc Son Temple, Pen Foundation, the Old Quarters. To expose IIT students to the Social Issues and Cultural Heritage of Vietnam, the students visited the Ethnology Museum of Hanoi, Ha Long Bay, Bat Trang Ceramic Village and ECO-Park, the Vietnamese Military History Museum and Hanoi Prison Museum, the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum and Temple of Literature.*

*During the visit to Vietnam, the IIT students worked with their Vietnamese counterparts to create a mobile application or web page for the National Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion Centre.*
