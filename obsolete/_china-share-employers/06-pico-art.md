*As any company venturing abroad can attest to, establishing a presence in a foreign country is not easy.*

*“When a Singapore company intends to go overseas, it is important to study and understand the market. Unlike the Singapore market, once you venture out, it feels like you are in the ocean – there are waves, tides, currents and sharks.”*

*The company’s first project in every new market is the initial step towards establishing a long-term presence.*

*“We use the first project we do as our showpiece… the money that we make is also channelled back into subsequent investments.”*

*Despite all the company has achieved overseas, Singapore is still home, says Mr Chia [group president of Pico Art].*

*“We are a global brand, but the Singapore office is still one of our most important offices… being a Singapore company also gave us a good credible standing overseas.”*
