*Following its first success, Ednovation tapped on IE Singapore’s Global Company Partnership grant to engage a consultant to create its pre-school franchise programme.*

*Dr Yen [founder and managing director of Ednovation] is also grateful for IE’s mission trips that helped to offer a first-hand overview of the cities and regions he was interested in. IE’s well-established government relations also opened new doors and elevated Ednovation’s standing in China.*

*“We want to pay it forward and broaden our service offerings”, says Dr Yen, “We are now working with IE Singapore to adopt a ‘plug and play’ concept that will enable smaller SME pre-school enrichment companies to tap of Ednovation’s established China network to test the market there.”*
