This study investigates the responsiveness of the healthcare system in Jiangsu and highlights the factors that impact responsiveness such as regional economic development level and geographic area. Findings showed that the responsiveness of Jiangsu’s healthcare system was rated as satisfactory based on a survey of 1938 adult residents of Jiangsu in 2011. Measures to increase the perceived level of responsiveness include the construction of more hospitals in rural regions, shorter hospital waiting times and providing a more conducive and comfortable medical environment for patients.
