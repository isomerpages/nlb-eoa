This article provides an overview of selected municipalities and provinces in China for those keen on exploring the possibility of living and working there. The information presented is gathered from open sources and is not exhaustive or meant to supplement or substitute legal and professional advice. 

### **Introduction**

This overview covers the municipalities of Chongqing and Tianjin and provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Shandong, Sichuan and Zhejiang. These municipalities and provinces were selected as Singapore has business councils, as well as substantial trade and investments, with each of them. The business councils “provide platforms for Singapore companies to network with Chinese government officials and communities.“[^1] They also deepen collaboration at the provincial level and help to strengthen bilateral relations and the internationalisation of Singapore companies.[^2]



### **Economy**

With the exception of Liaoning, these six provinces and Chongqing experienced high economic growth between 2015 and 2016. Their Gross Regional Product (GRP) growth ranged from -22.4 percent in Liaoning to 12.85 percent in Chongqing.
