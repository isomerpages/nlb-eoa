*Ten cities. Six months. One amazing internship. That sums up Lynette Lau’s one-of-a-kind experience at Grab Indonesia. She was there as part of Ngee Ann’s Global Entrepreneurial Internship Programme, which provides students with internship opportunities at start-ups across the globe.*

*… “Grab was rolling out its expansion plans, so I had the chance to travel to 10 different cities, including Medan, Yogyakarta, Bandung and Lombok. There, I did preliminary analysis of new markets and co-ordinated operations. I also helped to increase productivity by creating an improved incentive calculation template. I’m thankful that I was able to quickly pick up Bahasa Indonesia to interact with the locals from every city!”*
