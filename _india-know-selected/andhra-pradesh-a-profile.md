In December 2014, International Enterprise (IE) Singapore signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Infrastructure Corporation of Andhra Pradesh to jointly work on the master plan for Amaravati. Master planner, Surbana Jurong, submitted the city’s masterplan in 2015. In May 2017, two Singapore firms, Ascendas-Singbridge and Sembcorp Development, took on the development of the capital city project. They entered a joint venture with the Andhra Pradesh government to “master develop the commercial core of Amaravati”. The development is expected to be undertaken in phases over 15 to 20 years.[^20]

In February 2018, another MOU was signed between Singapore Business Federation (SBF) and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) to form the Andhra Pradesh-Singapore Business Council, which aims “to drive private sector business collaboration to strengthen Singapore-Andhra Pradesh economic ties … across priority sectors including smart infrastructure, agrifood and logistics.” Additionally, Singapore’s Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) is also partnering with Amaravati Partnership Office and the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority to set up an Innovation Corridor. The Innovation Corridor is “a platform to discover, pilot and scale innovative urban solutions” for use in Amaravati.[^21]
