The Brihadishvara temple in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu was built more than a thousand years ago, in the year 1010 by King Raja Raja Chola I. The genius of Rajaraja’s architect, who conceived and executed this stupendous structural feat, and the multifarious talents of the numerous artists employed to work on its stone carvings and mural paintings, are still apparent today. The temple is the supreme achievement of the Chola era and is indeed, one of the greatest masterpieces of Hindu architecture and art in the whole of India.
