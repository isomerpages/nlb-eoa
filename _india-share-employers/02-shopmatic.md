*Shopmatic may be based in Singapore but when the e-marketplace service provider start-up launched, it went global first – entering the challenging but promising Indian market before even Singapore’s.*

*“Some companies believe that you have to build your base here in Singapore first… but for us, we were thinking global from day one,” said Mr. Avula [co-founder and CEO of Shopmatic]. “The Singapore market is great and it’s important to us, but it’s equally if not more important to leverage the opportunities that other global markets have.”*

*“Our goal is to extend our footprint into multiple emerging economies,” said Mr. Avula. “It’s a tougher route, clearly. you’re going into countries that don’t necessarily understand e-commerce. So you work with that and build for that. But when the comprehension comes in and when there’s a tipping point in the market, then you’re very well placed to leverage the benefits that accrue out of that.”*
