Once under the jurisdiction of the military, policing in Indonesia has since been decentralised. In this pioneering work about the Indonesian police, scholar Muradi studies the changes in policing since Suharto came to power in 1966. Muradi argues that the professionalisation of the force, as well as the enforcing of modern and democratic policing, will lead to effective public control.
