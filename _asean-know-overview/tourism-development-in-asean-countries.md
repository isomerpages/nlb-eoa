[**Tourism in the green economy**](http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=201484965){:target="_blank"}

People are more aware now that the tourism sector can in fact make a major contribution to the green economy through more sustainable practices, climate change mitigation and ecotourism. However, there are ambiguities about how tourism and allied industries can maximise their contribution to human well-being and ensure environmental sustainability. The chapters on Malaysia and Thailand demonstrate the extent of the challenges and range of opportunities available for the tourism industry in these countries.

[**Heritage tourism in Southeast Asia**](http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=13719151){:target="_blank"}

This book examines heritage tourism across the Southeast Asian region from different disciplinary perspectives. Set against a backdrop of the demands, motivations and impacts of heritage tourism, the volume focuses on disputes and conflicts over what heritage is, what it means, and how it has been presented, re-presented, developed and protected for the sake of tourism. It weighs in on various issues from the ownership of heritage, access versus conservation needs to heritage as a commodity, as entertainment and as an educational medium.
