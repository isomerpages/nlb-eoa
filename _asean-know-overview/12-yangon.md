The New Yangon City seeks to address the challenges faced by the city due to the rise in population, urban infrastructure and to provide an opportunity for economic development. The vision of the project by the government-owned New Yangon Development Co (NYDC) is “Productive City, Liveable City” – a city that will be the country’s economic engine, while ensuring an inclusive, green and highly liveable experience for its residence. The first phase of the project involved developing 20,000 acres of land to the west of central Yangon into an urban industrial district. The first phase will comprise five village townships, two bridges, 26 kilometres of artery roads, 10 square kilometres of industrial estate, a power plant, transmission and distribution facilities, and a water and wastewater treatment plant. The project hopes to create two million jobs.[^9]
